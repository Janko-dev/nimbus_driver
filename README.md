# Nimbus Driver
This is my submission for the 53th edition of the Ludum Dare Game Jam.
The application is made in C with the SDL2 graphics library. Furthermore, the application links with `SDL2_image` and `SDL2_ttf`. 
The goal of the game is to deliver packets of stuff on your very own nimbus cloud. The people are waiting for their deliveries! 
There might be a few annowing birds that are minding their own business. Try to avoud them! 

To play the game, the following keys bindings are used:
- `up arrow` &uarr; to move up.
- `down arrow` &darr; to move down.
- `space` to throw a packet.
